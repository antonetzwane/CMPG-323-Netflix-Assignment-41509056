Project Functionality/Overview:

An ASP.NET solution must be created, preferably on Visual Studio, with specific models. A report must be generated on Power BI to further analyze and process the Netflix dataset provided. Fetching, storing, management and handling of data or the Netflix data will be done, for analysis purposes.Removing unecessary data duplicates on the data to prevent and avoid data redundancy and guarantee data accuracy. Further tasks like source control and scrum implementation occurs to ensure and track smooth progress.

Project Change/Progress:

Downloaded the Netflix file on dataworld and did not convert it to csv.

Created a new repository, CMPG 323 Netflix 41509056 on GitHub.

Added a readme to the repository for source control and to keep track of the project progress and the project as a whole.

Created a new project, CMPG 323 Netflix Project on GitHub.

Added tasks, milestones, statuses, labels, due dates, efforts and linked assessments to the Netflix project and tasks, clearly estimating how long each task should be. Grouped the board view by efforts(duration) and the columns by Status.

Created two charts, a line graph and column graph that compare statuses, efforts and labels.

Created an ASP.NET MVC Solution on Visual Studio.

Created two models namely, Netflix Data and DataLink, which links or loads the data in the netflix excel file.

Creates a controller named control data, to allow the control of data in GET, POST and DELETE methods.

Included the GET, GET BY ID, POST, PATCH/PUT, DELETE, FETCH and deduplicate methods in the API project.

Created a Power.BI report named NetflixReport, added to pages namely, High-Level Summary and Detailed Summary. Added KPIs, metric and other charts for visualization.
